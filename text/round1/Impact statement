The role of parasitism as main component of hybridization process in the European house mouse hybrid zone has been discussed for decades. Using an extracellular and an intracellular parasites, expected to trigger different immune pathways, in a large field sampling, we showed a similar pattern of increased resistance of hybrids compared to parental mice. Our work adds conclusive new results to a long standing debate on parasite intensities in this important host-parasite system. We expect this to largely settle the argument.
